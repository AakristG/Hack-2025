# PULSE

## Inspiration
We were inspired by a problem statement that, while still challenging, seemed to be achievable and within our skill set. We took UI inspiration from streamlined platforms such as X and modeled our AI dashboard after corporate analytic dashboards seen during our past internships.

## What it does
Pulse uses AI to collect insights from the data on customer happiness index, consolidates collected issues to suggest actionable steps for resolutions, and provides information about the customer experience through various visuals and graphs.

## Frameworks
Front-End: React
Back-End:  Node.js (Express, SQLite)
Cloud:     Firebase
AI:        Gemini API

## Challenges we ran into
We intended to scrape data from multiple sources online, but had difficultly accessing API's and permissions for sources such as Reddit. As a result we only had the time and resources to scrape data from Twitter, this is one of our main contestants for future application and growth.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how modern and readable our website is, it highlights the important elements while making user experiences enjoyable and easy. We're also proud of how we managed to have Gemini API assign user reviews to certain categories for further classification.

## What we learned
This was our team's first time utilizing Gemini API in a react web application and it was so cool how we were able to create relationships between the different components of the data. We also utilized some more complex animations on the login page than we previously attemped in the past.

## What's next for Pulse
The next steps ideally include adding a feature that allows AI to make graphs suitable for comparing data across different feedback categories, locations, and experiences. We also saw the opportunity for adding a customer sided interface to the T-Mobile Life App that would contribute to populating our database.
